# Tic-tac-toe Game

##General Description

This is a two-player tic-tac-toe game. It has a chalkboard design theme. It uses a table as it's main user interface, and a message board for registration/login/game complete messaging.

#Technologies used
I used JavaScript and jQuery to write the code for this project. JavaScript made most of the game logic run, and I used jQuery to make the display interactive. I used HTML and CSS to display the game.

We were given pre-written API to use for the backend, and some functions to use to communicate it. I modified those functions to translate my game logic into something that the API would understand.

#Approach taken
I took a functional approach to this project. I designed all the HTML/CSS before beginning to write the game logic. I tried to take small steps and make those appear on the page before moving on. For example, my first goal was to make an X appear when I clicked on my table. When that worked, I tried to get it to switch between X and O. Then I wrote some code to store those X's and O's in an object.
